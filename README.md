Installiation:    npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
Running the development server:   npm run dev

Overview
## package.json 
Where all our library get installed

## package-lock.json

It's pretty much the same as package.json but it locks all the packages.

## config file 
It's using the app directory

## json.config

## gitignore 
The stuff that we don't want to push on Github including environment variables.

## public
This is where we see all our images, svgs and whatnot ?

## pages
We use it for api in Next app ? (for all or that specific tutorial I was working ?)

What essentially this API rout is going to allow us to do is to query data from a DB
for example do off in here on the backend (server-side rendering with Next off on the server and using server-side component)

## App folder

This is where we define our pages
